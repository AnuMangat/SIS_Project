<center><h1>About This Project</h1><center>

<br> 

The student management system is a project where you act as an administrator in which you are able to add/delete/update student and faculty records.

You have the ability to log-in as a student and view your details, along with adding/deleting/updating courses.

You can also log in as a faculty member and  view your details and look into the courses you are scheduled to teach.
